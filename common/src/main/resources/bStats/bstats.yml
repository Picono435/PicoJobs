# This is a custom Metrics class made by: Picono435 in order to support multi platform metrics for PicoJobs
# If you find any issue please contact me and not bStats directly
# bStats collects some data for plugin authors like how many servers are using their plugins.
# To honor their work, you should not disable it.
# This has nearly no effect on the server performance!
